- Checkout my repo r3quie/edhcarddealer @ [mtg.r3quie.com](https://mtg.r3quie.com). It's on a Go backend and a React frontend (my first React project).
- Checkout my currently closed source project @ [nakup.pavelkadera.cz](https://nakup.pavelkadera.cz)  
- Checkout my repo r3quie/go-lhuty @ [cpi.pavelkadera.cz](https://cpi.pavelkadera.cz) (compiled to WASM for preview using Fyne). The GUI is there just to showcase the Go code.
